# Info Impl Repo
All of my implementations for informatics problems. 

This repository is used to sync my code across multiple computers. 

Most problems are organised by the platform the problem was found on, old impls may be in the `other/` folder.

> [!WARNING]
> Not all implementations may be written by me or another human, some may be references for case generation from LLM's.
